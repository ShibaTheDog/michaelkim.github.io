# IAT355

This is my IAT355 website, where over the course of the semester I will show my visualizations I created for this class here! I don't know exactly what ill be showing, but it will most likely consists of SVG-based tables, charts, whatever is a visualization that shows data (basically). Along with visualizations, it will serve as a place to showcase myself and what I am currently studying at SIAT!

The technologies used across this site will be HTML, CSS, JS, Observeable and Tableau! Stay tuned to see Observeable and Tableau in the near future, but currently HTML, CSS, and JS are currently being used! To get started, locate the navigation bar at the very top and navigate to the page that you want to take a look at! 


To get started using the site, access the website from the link here and visit the page you are interested in! Just as a quick reminder, the homepage contains information about myself and visualizations contains the visualizations I have made in this course! (The other pages are still work in progress, so interactivity wont work for those.)
